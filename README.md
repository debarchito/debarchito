### Debarchito Nath (a.k.a debarchito formerly \_.andew._, αη∂єω)
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is my primary programming language. I am kinda required to use [Python](https://python.org/). I also use [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [Zig](https://ziglang.org), C and ARM ASM.
- I use [Deno](https://deno.land/) for anything [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). JavaScript with JSDoc is also somewhat fine for me but I like my types.
- Used to do frontend; now I don't. I mean I do when I *need* to.
- I use a combination of Julia, Python and Rust for all my scientific needs. My courses are in Python though.
- Math nerd.
